# Desing for FPGA of a UART module

The purpose of the project is the design for FPGA of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter that allows the serial transmission/reception data of 8 bits at 9600 bauds. 
For this purpose, it is required the design in VHDL of a transmitter and receiver module. The functionality of the UART must be validated by means of the corresponding functional 
simulation, designing the appropriate test bench.
